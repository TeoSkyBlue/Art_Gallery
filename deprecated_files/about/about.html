We have also taken to big themes: the mutabilities of class, gender and ethnicity; the histories of nations and empires; the crises of what is very variously identified as 'Modernity' from the 12th to the 20th centuries. Yet, in recent decades we have taken our eyes off the very long term. We do not, with very few exceptions, write about the entire human story. And having written our time-and-place-specific histories, we generally do not indicate what light these studies throw on a diachronic or through-time perspective.Historians have done very well at digging deep and probing complexities.
